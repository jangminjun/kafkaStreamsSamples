# Garden - Back end

This is a minimal Quarkus application that simulates the back end of a garden application.
It provides a REST API for the front end.

## Exposed endpoints

- `garden/events`
- `garden/statuses`
- `sensor/measurements/enriched`
- `sensor/measurements/raw`

## Running the Application

You can run the application in local like any other Quarkus project:

```bash
./mvnw quarkus:dev
```
